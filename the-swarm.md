# üêù The swarm

We often talk about decentralization, but yet, crypto is dominated by a few large liquidity providers. These liquidities have their constraints and are not agile, we introduce the swarm, which is a large group of liquidity provider ( hedging) bot that source liquidity in place large liquidity providers cannot, and provide it onchain.

The swarm can take more risks as a liquidity provider, as each individual can manage his own risk. But with the ability to act as 1, when 1 large trade comes, thousands of swarm members can become liquidity providers to that trade.

PionerV1 introduces any asset, any LP cross margin with a hybrid model of cross-isolated liquidity. This means, that every actor is in cross-margin but is insured to not lose in case their counterparty loses and is protected for default waterfall.

Pioner Foundation also provides open source hedging bots, similar to a POS node, allowing to provide liquidity. To incentivize custom third-party hedging bots, each bot can force input their ETH address to be rewarded 15% of revenue generated by the protocol on trades that pass through.
