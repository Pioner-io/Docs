\
Moreover, these innovation allows a new world new set of DeFi.\
The extended counterparty risk work, allows safe multi-asset backing allowing derivative portfolio-backed Stablecoins and Lending.

The key feature of CCP is that each member pays for the default of other members, but with rules that allow pricing of the expected loss of CCP members. If an expected loss is too high, higher collateral and fee requirements can be set until the CCP cannot lose, but at the cost of capital efficiency. The CCP allows to reach the perfect balance between priceable risk and capital efficiency.

The role of a CCP isn't to default, it is to price the risk of default, and for liquidity providers to earn with a 99.5% expectancy if they are CCP members for 2 years.
